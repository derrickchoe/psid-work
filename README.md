# psid-work
The psid-work repository is designed to facilitate use of the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics. It can be used to pull, rename, and reshape publically-available PSID data.

## downloading and formatting the raw data
This repo is currently designed to handle PSID data from 1999 onwards. All necessary data files come from the <a href = "https://simba.isr.umich.edu/Zips/ZipMain.aspx" >"packaged data"</a> section of the PSID download center.
